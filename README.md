![Cat]([https://github.com/learntofly913/my-first-project/commit/9c9a7ef906599a72009817f88c69ee12ea338c88#diff-ea3c7f657c244abc9ec88fd2a11d38f597500ddefe8a918fdf501d7260fc8df])

If you need to resize images, you have to use an HTML tag, like this:
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Sleeping_cat_on_her_back.jpg](https://github.com/learntofly913/my-first-project/commit/9c9a7ef906599a72009817f88c69ee12ea338c88#diff-ea3c7f657c244abc9ec88fd2a11d38f597500ddefe8a918fdf501d7260fc8df7" width="300">

This is how you create code examples:
```
def main():
   L = ['8895580429', '9883807482', '9883366500', '8101608172', '9330502722']
   R = [i]
   # write your solution here

   if R in L:
    print("SCAM");

main()
```


## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:
[Twitter API]([https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs](https://cyberdecode.in/list-of-fraud-scammers-mobile-numbers-in-india/))

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

## Challenges

its could not be 100% success as there could be new scammer in society whose are still hidden to be uncovered based on experienced feedback.

## What next?

Need more analystic data to analyse and find more fake scammers around us.
